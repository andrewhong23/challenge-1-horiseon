## Description

This Module 1 Challenge required me to edit the HTML code to a more semantic HTML code.  using a more semantic HTML code will help with organization, as well as provide a structure on how this website was built. Editing the code came editing the CSS as well to match the new HTML code and edit how the content will appear on the web page.  

### Changes to the code: 

-Some changes that I made were creating sections, articles within each section, as well as added a footer to the end of the HTML.  
- Every picture now contains an alt tag. 

-Within the CSS I commented out the repeat code, and in turn had to create a new class/ID to keep images the same. 

-Created a new title to the page to give a more desciptive and meaningful title.
